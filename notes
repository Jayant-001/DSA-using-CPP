Way to identify problem is recursive or not
1. recursive based DS like tree, graph...
2. there are choice and decision (here we will use Input-Output method)
3. problem is recursively difined (here we will use IBH(Induction, Base case, Hypothesis) method)


                -----------------------DP-------------------------
Way to identify DP problem
1. they will ask for optimal solution
2. there is always 2 or more choices
3. recursive function will called for more then 1 times (recursive function call > 1)

Type of Knapsack-
    1. 0-1 Knapsack (only occurrence of a item)
    2. Fractional knapsack (we can break item into its fraction)
    3. Unbounded knapsack (allow multiple occurrences of a item)

Base Case = Think of the smallest valid input
